<h1> jarBuild </h1>

Project will be released soon!

A tool which makes it easier to generate a jar file similar to the 'Export' feature that Eclipse provides but with command-line instead. 

<h3> Usage </h3>

1. Download the release project to your desktop and extract the package.
2. Navigate to bin/jarBuild.exe
3. Execute the program to access the builder UI.
4. Add your jar settings and details.
5. Click 'Build' to compile a jar file. If error occurs, it will log them to your desktop.

<h3> Language </h3>

The builder was created in C# which means it will only work on Windows computers. If you want the jar builder to support older systems below Windows 7, please debug a new application inside the project through Visual Studio with your own desirable framework.
